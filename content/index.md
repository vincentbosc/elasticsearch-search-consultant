title: From Elasticsearch Consultant to Search Specialist
---
## Why this site exists  
Elastic consultants are experts at building, scaling, and securing Elasticsearch clusters. Many also have deep experience in Observability and Security.

But in recent years, Search-focused use cases have been less common — until now.

With the rise of AI, LLMs, and agent workflows, **Search is back at the center of modern applications**. As more Search projects return to Elastic, we need consultants who understand not just how to run Elasticsearch, but how to design **effective and relevant search experiences**.

This site exists to help consultants make that transition — from **managing Elasticsearch** to **mastering Search**.
