title: From Elasticsearch Consultant to Search Specialist
---
## Why this site exists  
Elastic consultants are experts at building, scaling, and securing Elasticsearch clusters. Many also have deep experience in Observability and Security.

But in recent years, Search-focused use cases have been less common — until now.

With the rise of AI, LLMs, and agent workflows, **Search is back at the center of modern applications**. As more Search projects return to Elastic, we need consultants who understand not just how to run Elasticsearch, but how to design **effective and relevant search experiences**.

This site exists to help consultants make that transition — from **managing Elasticsearch** to **mastering Search**.

## What “Search Consulting” means  
A Search Consultant blends engineering with data science, linguistics, and UX.  
They don’t just ask *“Does it index?”* — they ask *“Does it surface what matters?”*

You’ll learn to:  
- Design **relevance strategies** beyond BM25 — hybrid retrieval, embeddings, re-ranking, feedback loops  
- Conduct **query analysis** and interpret search analytics to guide tuning  
- Integrate **semantic and vector search** into classic Elasticsearch setups  
- Translate business goals into measurable search KPIs  
- Collaborate with UX teams on **facets, synonyms, autocomplete, and result design**  
- Build iterative search evaluation frameworks for continuous improvement  

---

## Who this site is for  
- **Elasticsearch consultants** ready to specialise in Search relevance and user experience  
- **Solution architects** who want to design complete search systems — from ingestion to insight 

If you’ve deployed Elasticsearch and now want to master the *why* and *how* behind great search results — this is your next step.
